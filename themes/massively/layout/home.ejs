                My name is Ximin Lin. I am a second-year master Computer Science student in University of Michigan Ann Arbor. I took my undergrad Computer Engineering in University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.

                During my undergrad, I focused on machine learning. I have done projects related to Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Leraning, and Data Science.

                In my graudate study, I plan to broaden my knowledge by learning like SQL, Web development, and Computer Network. In the meantime, I like to think how these areas can benefit from machine learning.

                I enjoy singing and I am also good at it, especially singing while driving on a trip with my frinds (IDK if that's legal but who cares). I once missed a good chance to learn pilot and I regret now. In the future I plan to learn pilot, ski.

                In my way of losing 10 kg, I picked up the habit of fitness. Now I am addicted to gym.
